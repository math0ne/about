<p class="para">
  SOS uses an xHTML/CSS interface with JavaScript animations and AJAX interactions to enhance the responsiveness and usability of the application. We aimed to create a dynamic online work environment that allows you to feel like you are working with your sales team in the same building.

### Usability

We have kept the user interface simple and friendly. When you first sign in, you are welcomed with a page that will detail your day of work. A full manual as well as guided documentation was developed to allow users of any technical ability to learn how to use the system. 

### Adaptability</h4>

The real estate industry is an industry that has to deal with a lot of data. Not only that, but they must also deal with constantly changing data formats and functions. We developed SOS to allow the creation of industry-specific business models and to allow dynamic reporting based on that information. Furthermore, SOS allows you to easily collect data from potential customers by creating custom landing pages that can be deployed anywhere on the internet, use your own &#8220;Thank You&#8221; page, and still have data seamlessly entered into the CMS.

### Security</h4> 

Personal data privacy is a major international issue, and with the amount of personal financial data our system has to track, security was at the forefront of everything we developed for Sales Operation Services. SOS is protected from SQL injection attacks to prevent one user from stealing another user&#8217;s data. All AJAX code has been fully secured as well.
