This is my dedicated stand alone drupal irssi setup. Here are some features:

  * Autoconnects to irc.freenode.net
  * Joins my fav channels #php and #drupal
  * Included customized and configured version of [Console](http://sourceforge.net/projects/console/)
  * Custom reshacked system tray icon
  * Custom [irssi](http://www.irssi.org/) theme

You can of course easily change which channels and networks it joins by consulting the irssi documentation.

Usage:

  * Install the font: [Dina](http://www.donationcoder.com/Software/Jibz/Dina/index.html)
  * Extract IRC.zip
  * Run IRC.bat

Don&#8217;t forget to set your nick and such: 

    /set nick somenick
    /set user_name someuser
    /set real_name Bob User

To switch windows type:

    /w 1 #To go to Status window
    /w 2  ### To go to #drupal window
    /w 3  ### To go to #php window

Irssi and Console are GNU Open Source Software Packages.
