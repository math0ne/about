I just released a little php script I use to display my basecamp feed on my desktop as a text list.
  


    A simple php program that will take a basecamp feed and format it for text 
    viewing.  I use it to display my basecmap feed on my desktop with samurize.
    
    Setup
    
    1) Add your username/pass/feedurl to the basecamp2php.php file
    2) Set the script to run every X via cron
    
    SAMPLE OUTPUT:
