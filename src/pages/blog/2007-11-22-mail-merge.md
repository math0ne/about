Mail merge is a Direct Mail Marketing Campaign Manager.

This Direct Mail Application was developed for use in the real estate industry. It tracks **all of your (snail) mailing needs**, including:</p> 

<ul class="paraul">
  <li>
    Uploading client lists in <strong>XLS, TSV, and CSV</strong> formats
  </li>
  <li>
    Scheduling follow-up letters
  </li>
  <li>
    Allowing printing of letters, in batches or individually, using Print CSS style sheets
  </li>
  <li>
    Managing multiple mailing users
  </li>
  <li>
    Configuring all scheduling options
  </li>
  <li>
    Defining as many stock letters as you need
  </li>
</ul>

Mail Merge was designed to be **usable by anyone with no previous knowledge of the application**. Because the application is constantly accessed by different users on a daily basis, it was very important that all functions be completely self-explanatory.

To this end, we designed Mail Merge to function more like an **interactive document** than a traditional application. Functionality is revealed through explanation. Each page greets you with an introductory paragraph delineating its functions and outlining the pageï¿½s main links. **Mail Merge explains why you need the functionality, not just what the functionality does.**

Mail Merge is a **closed system** that was developed for a major U.S. Mortgage Foreclosure Agency and, as such, is not open to the public. We have provided some screenshots of the site:
