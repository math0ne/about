  blurb: |
    I am the Lead Developer at [@howtomedia](https://twitter.com/InnerBody), an education network that provides interactive maps of the human body. I use a variety of Open Source Content Management and Geographic Information Systems tailored to emphasize frontend performance and ensure that we rise above the noise in a tightly competitive search landscape. 

    In my personal time, I can usually be found creating React applications and obsessing about the Terminal by hacking on my fully deployable dotfiles.  Here are some of the technologies I work with daily and love:

    * Javascript, Typescript, PHP, Ruby, Python, Bash
    * Drupal, Wordpress, Gatsby, Jekyll, GraphCMS
    * Node, jQuery, React, Redux, Vue, Openlayers, Mapbox, Leaflet, Rails
    * GraphQL, Mysql, Redis, Loopback
    * Docker, Ansible, Gulp, NPM, Webpack, AWS, GCP, Kubernetes
    * Nginx, Apache, Varnish, Mod Pagespeed, Memcache
    * Mocha, PhantomJS, CasperJS, TravisCI
